### Start development mode

From the Starter theme folder, start development mode:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Changes you make to your styles, scripts, and Handlebars files will show up automatically in the browser. CSS and Javascript will be compiled and output to the `built` folder.

Press `ctrl + c` in the terminal to exit development mode.

### Build, zip, and test your theme

Compile your CSS and JavaScript assets for production with the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

Create a zip archive:

```bash
npm run zip
```

Use `gscan` to test your theme for compatibility with Ghost:
